<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for updates">
    Click the **BrowserOS Feedback** extension (bug icon) in the toolbar, then click **Check for Updates**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Download the latest version">
    Download the Windows installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/browseros-ai/BrowserOS/releases).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the installer">
    Double-click the downloaded installer to start the update. You'll see a temporary folder appear — this is normal and expected on Windows.

    </Frame>

    Wait about 30–40 seconds. The temporary folder will disappear on its own, and the updated **BrowserOS** app will automatically appear on your desktop.

    <Note>If BrowserOS was already running, close it completely and reopen it for the update to take effect.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Allow the BrowserOS Agent">
    When BrowserOS opens, you may see a popup asking to allow **BrowserOS Agent** to access the network. Click **Allow** — the agent runs as a separate process alongside the browser and needs this permission to work.

    </Frame>

    <Warning>If you click Cancel, the agent won't be able to connect and you'll see a "Failed to Fetch" error. If this happens, go to **Windows Security → Allow an app through your network settings** and enable **BrowserOS Agent**.</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your settings and data will be preserved after the update.
